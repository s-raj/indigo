My name is Sharat Raj. I am an Engineer by profession. I work in Automotive space and I am currently contributing my bit in the global pursuit of making Autonomous commercial vehicles a reality.   

I come from a beautiful place called Ponnani on the banks of the Arabian sea where the Arabian sea, Bharathapuzha and Biyyam backwaters meet.
